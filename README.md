# bodyfat-calculator

Note: Still under developement. 

I designed the bodyfat-calculator app in order to help health professionals calculate and store clients bodyfat percentages. This would provide a simple way of
storing and tracking clients weight loss progress.

The stack I used for this app includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, MongoDB, Node and Express. 

I am still yet to add in authentication and authorisation and finally deploy to Heroku.  

Challenges:
  1. One of the more difficult tasks was deciding the appropriate way of storing client test data and then retrieving it and displaying it. I used MongoDB Atlas to store a users name and their test results.
